This repository can be used as a template for creating other HK packages. It contains all the necessary files and information for\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item integration in HK installation framework,
\item basic dependencies with Tool\+Framework\+Core and WCSim,
\item Continuous Integration and Docker support,
\item package exportation via CMake.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that the CI of this template are not guaranteed to work if used outside the hyperk organisation.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Defining your own repo}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
Below, we assume you have already install {\ttfamily hk-\/pilot} and the dependencies you plan to use in your future package\+: as currently implemented, the {\ttfamily myhklib} relies on Tool\+Framework\+Core and WCSim (and their dependencies). Therefore, make sure you have them installed!

To create a new repo\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item use the \char`\"{}\+Use this template\char`\"{} button, instead of forking and choose the name of your package e.\+g. {\ttfamily mypackage},
\item change the project name in {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt} to {\ttfamily mypackage},
\item change the {\ttfamily self.\+\_\+package\+\_\+name} in {\ttfamily hkinstall.\+py} to {\ttfamily mypackage} (same for the name of the class),
\item start a first compilation using {\ttfamily hkp install mypackage}
\item if successful, you can start editing the source code (add more source files, applications...) and the CMake files.
\end{DoxyItemize}

TODO\+: create a script that does the above automatically\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Creating new tools}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
To create new tools\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item run the {\ttfamily new\+Tool.\+sh} bash script,
\item add {\ttfamily hk\+\_\+add\+\_\+tool($<$tool\+\_\+name$>$)} in the CMake\+Lists.\+txt file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

TODO\+: add documentation about the other scripts\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Continuous Integration}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
If you\textquotesingle{}d like to use the Continuous Integration, you would need to \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item have the new repo in the hyperk organisation (otherwise you can not access hyperk resources correctly). If so, you would have to ask a hyperk organisation owner to create the repo for you!
\item ask a hyperk owner to add the repository to the allowed repositories\+: \href{https://github.com/orgs/hyperk/packages/container/hk-meta-externals/settings}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/orgs/hyperk/packages/container/hk-\/meta-\/externals/settings}}
\item add a SSH key in the {\ttfamily Actions secrets} for this repo
\item
